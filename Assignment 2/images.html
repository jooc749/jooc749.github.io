            The younger generation has created an experience economy in which they spend money on experiences rather than materialistic things. And there’s been a trend of concerts and festivals such as Coachella, that people will pay hundreds of dollars to go 
to concerts.</p>

<p>Do you like them or not? Thoughts on festival culture and how millennials and the younger generation are going into debt to afford festivals? 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="answer1">
        <p>
            I personally haven’t been to a lot 
of concerts, but the ones that I have been to were very enjoyable, I had 
a great time at them. I definitely want to go to more, I think it’s a really 
interesting way to like, get online. 
Interesting. That’s the word that I think, uh, it’s a great way to get closer to the artists, if that makes sense. So like sure we listened to them digitally, but like being there in person and experiencing that as a whole different thing. Um, and I think it 
has been a really big thing amongst people, our age. Everyone wants
 to go to a concert and it’s sort of like an accepted thing. </p>

<p>I think that sort of goes hand in hand with how, um, how our generation resonates with music. They’re very, um, invested emotionally. Like, they’re very invested in the music and they’re very, uh, passionate about it. And I think the festivals are just like a great place for them. So, um, what’s the word that I’m thinking of? It’s a great place for them to, um, experience it physically.

            I don’t know if you watched the 
Netflix documentary, FYRE. It’s about 
a festival, like a scam, basically about how a bunch of people like young people pay to go to like this island for this whole festival, but it wasn’t real. <p>What are your thoughts on 
that culture?</p>

    </div>

    <div id="answer2">
        <p>
            I think that is an interesting sort of trend or, shift in ideology in our generation, but, I would sort of just relate it back to any material sort of possession, like people go into debt to buy something.</p>

<p>I think they just treat it the same way. I know other people, or people in the older generation would be like, how would you go into debt for that.

            Okay, so kind of shifting gears, but music recently like, Beyonce’s visual album, “ Black is King,” and Childish Gambino’s, “This is America,” are some of the recent, powerful statements through music. </p>

<p>How do you see music evolving
to become a powerful tool to promote change and education and representation?

    <div id="answer3">
        <p>
            I think it’s definitely becoming the dynamic platform that allows for, 
um, a lot of. Um, a lot more channels of representation. So it’s, how do 
I phrase this? Um, it’s a really accessible and public sort of platform, but, um, it doesn’t limit, it doesn’t limit itself. And it’s demographics. So like, I think it’s a great, what was your question again? It’s a great,... 

Yeah. So there’s no limits to the demographic and it, um, it just promotes sort of, um, It promotes discovery into different cultures or different genres. And, um, I see it being a great, um, form of communication, if that makes sense. You can connect with people of all different backgrounds that somehow have the same interests.

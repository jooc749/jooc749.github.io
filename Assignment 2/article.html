        <p>
            This project was inspired by some of the topics brought forth in Spotify's article, "Everything You Wanted to Know About Gen Z (But Were Afraid to Ask)."
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="p1">
        <p>
            

Below are five defining traits of Gen Z uncovered in the study (which encompassed the U.S., U.K., Australia, Germany, the Philippines, Brazil, and beyond), as well as the streaming-related trends they inspire. These provide clear on-ramps for understanding and connecting with the world’s first generation of truly global citizens—whether or not they’ve used a record player.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div id="numberone">
    <p>#1. All the Feels</p>
    <p>Members of Gen Z are in touch with their feelings, and they understand the importance of expressing and addressing them.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="p2">
        <p>
            Gen Zers, however, actively address their feelings—often through music, and specifically via their “bag playlists” (yes, bag) of sad songs. Not only is listening to these playlists up 45% year over year, but 49% of participants in the study said they find camaraderie in sharing their feelings of sadness and loneliness.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="number2">
        <p>
            #2. Band of Others
        </p>
        <p>
            Gen Z believes that music allows people to connect with one another and with different cultures. They listen to more international music than any other demographic.


        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="p3">
        <p>
            More than half the participants in the study said they’re friends with someone from another country online. So it’s no surprise that Gen Z is fueling the K-Pop craze. K-Pop quickly became one of the 10 most-streamed genres worldwide, forging international bonds among listeners likely because of its upbeat, heartstring-tugging style and lyrical blend of Korean and English.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="number3">
        <p>
            #3. Subliminal Attraction
        </p>
        <p>
            Gen Z craves discovery. Finding new things, ideas, music, podcasts, hobbies, and experiences makes them feel good.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="p4">
        <p>
            Gen Z believes anyone anywhere has the power to break though the social media clutter and become influencers. The more relatable a person (say, a podcast host), the more trust and influence he or she engenders—driving discovery and, therefore, happiness. Our past research backs this up. 72% of people we surveyed in 2018 said discovery boosts happiness—so give them something new and authentic.

    <div id="number4">
        <p>
            #4. PolyFly
        </p>
        <p>
            Gen Z wants to be part of the political conversation—and their seamless access to technology and all types of content empowers them engage in a way no generation previously has.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="p5">
        <p>
            Podcasts that mix lifestyle and politics top the charts. See The Daily and Pod Save America. A solid 66% of respondents said they expect brands to be part of the debate, to promote progressive values, and to play a more meaningful role in society. “Our eyes have been opened to the lack of leadership by those in positions of power,” says Canadian pop star Alessia Cara, “and in turn, so many of us have had to step up in their place.”
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="number5">
        <p>
            #5. Surround Sound
        </p>
        <p>
            Gen Z may appear to be obsessed with their screens, but they value audio as an escape from visual stimulation overload.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="p6">
        <p>
            Audio isn’t just background noise, said 50% of the study respondents; it plays a huge role in their everyday lives. So silence can be golden too. To raise awareness of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Marie Claire ran a campaign of 30-second silent spots on Spotify. Listeners assumed there was a glitch and looked at their phones, only to see a message explaining the danger of staying silent about violence. Powerful, impactful communications such as this leave a lasting impression with Gen Z.
